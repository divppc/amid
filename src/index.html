          <h2>Amid wants to help you grow your business.</h2>
          <p>
            Lebanese entrepreneurs, just like you, are missing out on revenue
            every day and we want to change that. Just because you don’t have
            the time, the patience, or the tools to adapt to modern-day
            marketing doesn’t mean your product is no good or your service is
            terrible. We believe in you. As a matter of fact, there is no
            marketing agency that knows you like we do. <b>Amid</b>, the
            modern-day marketing agency, was founded by Amid Slim, a self-taught
            Lebanese entrepreneur who learned marketing through error, trial,
            and commitment. His idea, in 2013, to consolidate China’s largest
            shopping sites into one foreign platform was genius but failed to
            last. Failure left questions only modern-day marketing had the right
            answers for. Idea was not enough. Risk was not enough. Hustle was
            not enough. Advertising was also not enough. <b>Amid</b>, the
            agency, was born 6 years later, in Beirut, with a mission to help
            other Lebanese-owned businesses last forever.
