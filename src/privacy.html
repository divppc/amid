            Amid cares about your privacy. For this reason, we retain data for
            as long as necessary to conduct studies, connect, provide services
            and thereafter for a variety of marketing purposes. This date
            includes personal information such as Name, Address, Business Name,
            Business Address, Phone Number, Email Address, and other data
            collected that could directly or indirectly identify you and your
            business. We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect
            and limiting its use and its purpose to only that. We may share your
            data with affiliated companies and trusted third parties to
            integrate their services into our services and perform tasks you
            have agreed to. Such tasks may include conducting research,
            performing analysis and customer demographics, hiring freelance
            contractors, processing payments, serving advertisements, and
            creating service related accounts on your behalf. We also use
            multiple web analytics tools provided by service partners such as
            Google Analytics, MixPanel and Singular to collect information about
            how you interact with our website, including pages you visit, what
            site you visited prior to visiting our website, how much time you
            spend on pages, what operating system and browser you use and
            network and IP information. We use the information provided by these
            tools to improve our services. These tools place cookies in your
            browser to indentify you as a unique user. Each cookie cannot be
            used by anyone other than the services provider (ex: Google for
            Google Analytics). The information collected from the cookie may be
            transmitted to and stored by these service partners on servers in a
            country other than the country in which you reside. Though
            information collected does not include personal data such as name,
            address, billing information, etc., the information is used and
            shared by these service providers in accordance with their
            respective privacy policies. If you have any questions related to
            our privacy policy, please send an email over to
